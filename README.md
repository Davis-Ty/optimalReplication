# optimalReplication
Tyon Davis 

You are going to write a Java program to find the optimal allocation of fragment replicas to sites in a 
distributed database. The program will read and parameter file which defines necessary parameter to 
decide how each fragment will be access in term of the expected cost of query and update, expected 
probability of query and update to each fragment. In the text file, the # indicates the comments of each parameter.  (DONE)


Your program should be able to find and print optimal allocation for each fragment and display the 
overall cost of all possible replication as well. The optimal replication which is the lowest cost among all 
should be also printed. (DONE)

I opened the doc and scanned it for all information needed. However, I followed the the class video caculations for the optimal allocation for each fragment and overall cost of all possible replication. Overall, I have completed the assignment to the best of my abilities.
